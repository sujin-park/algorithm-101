### 문제 설명
Invert a binary tree.

 / \   / \
1   3 6   9

Trivia:
This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:

Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can’t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.

### 문제 풀이
```javascript
const invertTree = (root) => {
  if(!root) return null;

  const tree = new TreeNode();

  tree.val = root.val;
  tree.left = invertTree(root.right);
  tree.right = invertTree(root.left);
  return tree;
};
```
